## `apt` proxy madness

A while ago I had set up a proxy tunnel to a remote server so I could by setting the `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables. 
But for some reason, when I wanted to do a `apt-get update`, it would error out saying it couldn't connect to local proxy.... I had unset the environment variables as my user and root user. Wth? 

Somehow, those variables had been also been set in `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/95proxies`, gah. Mystery solved.
