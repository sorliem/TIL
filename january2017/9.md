## Environment variable peruisng

I was doing a debug build in Travis and was looking at all the envioronment variables looking
for a specific value. They are always in random order it seems. I did a `env | less` just to scroll
through them, then I thought, this would be super awesome if they were sorted. 

```
env | sort | less
```

Yay!
