## `tmux` sessions

Previously when I want to create a tmux session for monitoring my Minecraft server,
I would do a `<C-b> d` to detach and do a `tmux ls` to view my sessions.
TIL that you can do a `tmux attach` to attach to the highest numbered session instead of doing
a `tmux attach-session -t 0`.
