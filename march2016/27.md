## Arch Linux Installation

Today was my first time sucessfully installing Arch, whew! Some roadblocks I had to get around were:

* navigating and learning to use `parted`
* formatting the partitions with the appropriate file system (UEFI vs MBR)
* forgetting to take out the virtual disk to not boot back to the disk
* getting networking up inside virtualbox

Neat stuff, now to install on a real machine!
