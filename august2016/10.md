## Logging debug output... oops

While trying to see what Logstash was spitting out, I thought it would be a good idea to 
also put a `file` block in the `output` section to a file in `/tmp`.
Then I could just `tail` the file and see whats coming through in real time. 
(For some reason I didn't want to do `stdout`, idk.)

Anyway, I tried to look at recent data in Kibana and there was no data to be seen for the 
last 15 mintues. Weird. 

Going back to Logstash, I tried to `less` a file but then got this unexpected error.

```
cannot create temp file for here-document: No space left on device 
```

Huh? I noticed with a `df -h` that the whole disk was full. Oh right! 
I have been growing a file in `/tmp` until it filled up the disk, doh. 
`rm`'d it, restarted Logstash with the config edited to not output to a file.
