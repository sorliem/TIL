## Elasticsearch plugin

Today the two nodes in my ES cluster weren't discovering each other and I was stumped as to why. 
I checked the `iptables` rules again to make sure there wasn't a rule blocking 9200-9300. 
Looking at the logs there were some error messages with the Marvel plugin, but I did not think that
could affect the cluster formation. 

Turns out it does.

I think somewhere I read that error in plugin initialization prevent cluster formation and in that moment
it clicked. I deleted the plugin becuase I didn't really use it, restarted both nodes, and voila, the 
nodes discovered each other and started allocating shards. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.
