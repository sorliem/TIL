## ELK stack stuff, several things

1. Why wasn't kibana showing '.raw' fields from the template I was applying to my Logstash configuration?

Turns out I didn't refresh the field list in kibana and so the raw fields were there, just not refreshed... gah.

2. Why is ES in "red" state??

Don't know why I didn't see this before, but the disk utilization was at 91%, and aparrently ES doesn't index or try
to reallocate when it gets over the 90% threshold. Deleted some indexes.

3. But then, why aren't the shards reallocating?

I forgot I switched the `cluster.routing.allocation.enable = false` earlier, just needed to set that to true and the 
shards started to reallocate. 

```bash
curl -XPUT "localhost:9200/_cluster" -d '{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "true"
  }
}'
```


ES version used = 1.5.1
Kibana version = 4.1.0
