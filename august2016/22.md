## Java tasks

Today I was messing around with the Elasticsearch/Kibana/Logstash 5.0 betas and came across a useful [command](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/stopping-elasticsearch.html#stopping-elasticsearch) in their documentation: `jps`.

```
$ jps | grep Elasticsearch
```

Allows you to list all java processes and their pid's. Neato!
