## `tmux` sessions

Today I was wondering if there was a way to launch `tmux` sessions in a more automated fashion, like for use in a provisioning script.
I learned that you can make `tmux` sessions and send them to the background with a command:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s my-session-name '/home/sorliem/start-program-and-monitor.sh'
```

However if the program exits and doesn't persist, the tmux session will close. I'd like the session to persist, but maybe that is a future TIL...


ADDENDUM

Writing documentation in Google Docs is not the greatest, but it is a good solution for a team environment.
I was frustrated with writing code snippets inline with other text becuase it was a lot of mouse clicks to get the right
formatting. 

Docs has a cool feature where you can highlight a portion of text, right click on it, and select "Select all matching text".
So how could I make all code snippets a tiny bit different than normal text without moving my mouse?
If you hit `<Ctrl><Shift> + <` it decreases the font size. Type your snippet then hit `<Ctrl><Shift> + >` to increase
back to normal. 
Later when you are done with your session, highlight any snippet, select all of it, then apply the formatting you want to it (I do font type, 
size 9 font, and light gray background) and it applies to all the snippets. Hooray!
