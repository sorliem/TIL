## `tmux` sessions

Today I was wondering if there was a way to launch `tmux` sessions in a more automated fashion, like for use in a provisioning script.
I learned that you can make `tmux` sessions and send them to the background with a command:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s my-session-name '/home/sorliem/start-program-and-monitor.sh'
```

However if the program exits and doesn't persist, the tmux session will close. I'd like the session to persist, but maybe that is a future TIL...
