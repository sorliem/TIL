## Adding a node to an Elasticsearch cluster

Today I added a third node to out Elasticsearch cluster.

__Specs:__

* Ubuntu 14.04
* 32gb ram
* Elasticsearch 1.5.2 (Yes, I know, time to upgrade)

Some key settings I had to configure before starting:

* Do a `sudo update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10` to make ES start up by default
* Modify JVM heap allocation

```
$ sudo vim /etc/default/elasticsearch
ES_HEAP_SIZE=16g
MAX_OPEN_FILES=65535
MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY=unlimited
```

* Install `cloud-aws` plugin for node discovery

```
$ cd /usr/share/elasticsearch && sudo bin/plugin install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-cloud-aws/2.5.1
```

* Set all of the settings to match the other two nodes' `elasticsearch.yml` files. Except for `node.name`, of course.

After that, `sudo service elasticsearch start` and watch the logs on all three nodes to make sure they found each other.

Success! :feelsgood:
