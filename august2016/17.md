## Kibana visualizations & `crontab`

I had made a visualization a while back based on a search in a certain index.
The index happened to be a days worth of info.
But now I wanted to expand it to match the `[logstash-]YYYY.MM.DD` format.
In Kibana 4.1.10, you can't do that, grr. They are [aware](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/3668) of that, but I hope they fix it soon.

For crontab, there was a job missing, so I did a `crontab -e` to edit the file. 
I learned that cron logs to `syslog` so `less +F /var/log/syslog` showed me that the cron was working.
