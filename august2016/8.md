## TMUX & `iptables`

* TMUX

One thing I always didn't like about TMUX is that copy paste didn't work in most terminals.
But then I found out you can do `leader + [` to go into vim visual mode and `yy` yank stuff
and then `leader + ]` to paste at the command line. Neat! You can also
just hold `shift` and highlight and copy normally.

* `iptables`

I learned that you NEVER want to write a rule called `iptables -A {CHAIN} -j DROP`. Never again.
Don't do it.
