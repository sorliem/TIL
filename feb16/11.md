## Suspend vim sessions easily

Commonly I want to exit vim and return to the command line, then go back. My cowoker
told me about the `<C-z>` trick to suspend the current job. Then in my `.vimrc` I made a mapping

```vim
nnoremap q :w<CR><C-z>
```
which writes out my changes, then sends the job to the background, making it act a lot like `less`.
