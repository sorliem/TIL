##  TIL data from async calls cannot be assigned to variables outside its scope

I was trying to request graph data from Google BigQuery and was puzzled at why my
data variable had nothing in it when the promise finished executing.

```javascript
var graphData = [];
gapi.client.request(args).then(function() {
  var body = JSON.parse(result.body);
  graphData.push({ foo: 4, bar: "qux" });
  ...
}
```
Apparently you cannot assign stuff you get from an async call to a variable outside
the scope since we don't know when that promise will execute.

I still haven't figured out how to get around this (I hopefully will), but, TIL.
