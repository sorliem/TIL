## MOTD on debain systems

I learned how to make a custom message of the day. Run a `sudo apt-get install update-motd`
and a `/etc/update-motd.d` directory is created with scripts that are numbered. The scripts
are run in numbered ordered like runlevels in init systems. That makes it easy to 
modularize your greeting.
